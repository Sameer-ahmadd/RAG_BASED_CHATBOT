2.9 Shallow vs. Deep Learning
A shallow learning algorithm learns the parameters of the model directly from the features
of the training examples. Most supervised learning algorithms are shallow. The notorious
exceptions are neural network learning algorithms, speciﬁcally those that build neural
networks with more than one layerbetween input and output. Such neural networks are
calleddeep neural networks . In deep neural network learning (or, simply, deep learning),
contrary to shallow learning, most model parameters are learned not directly from the features
of the training examples, but from the outputs of the preceding layers.
Don’t worry if you don’t understand what that means right now. We look at neural networks
more closely in Chapter 6.
