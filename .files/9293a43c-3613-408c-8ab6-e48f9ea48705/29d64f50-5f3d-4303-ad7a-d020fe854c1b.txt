to rebuild the model from scratch. Other algorithms (such as Naïve Bayes, multilayer percep-
tron, SGDClassiﬁer/SGDRegressor, PassiveAggressiveClassiﬁer/PassiveAggressiveRegressor
in scikit-learn) can be trained iteratively, one batch at a time. Once new training examples
are available, you can update the model using only the new data.
Finally, some algorithms, like decision tree learning, SVM, and kNN can be used for both clas-
siﬁcation and regression, while others can only solve one type of problem: either classiﬁcation
or regression, but not both.
Usually, each library provides the documentation that explains what kind of problem each
algorithm solves, what input values are allowed and what kind of output the model produces.
The documentation also provides information on hyperparameters.
